C++ is a pure programming language that use different concepts like 
variables, datatypes, functions, loops, OOP, If-Else Statment and many more
Decision Ability

Game Development C++ 
Python purly based on C++ programming 
C++ is very powerful programming 
and its high level programming language.
C++ is a Compiler Based programming language 
Interpreter and Compiler
Compiler will execute our whole

Programming Fundamental in C++:
1. Variables 
2. Loops
so on

int a = 10; 
Line of Code, Program, 


Syntax:
    A set of rules that how to write a code in a programming language

Variables:
    datatype variable_name = varaible_value;
    Statment Terminator is semicolon.
    = this is assignment operator in C++
    variable_name its user_define variable
    There are some rule for variable naming.
    1. We cannot use number at the start of name. like 3A invalid, A3 is valid
    2. space between words not allow. example first name this is invalid and firstname is valid name 
    3. hypen is not allow between words for variable names. example "first-name" invalid and valid is "first_name" 
    4. Special Characters cannot use for the varialbe name. %, $ 
    5. We can use underscore (_) at the start.

    Brackets in Programming:
    1. Curly Brackets { }
    2. Square Brackets [ ]
    3. Parathesis ( )
    4. Angular Brackets < >

    In C++ there are many Reserved Words that use for specific purpose.
    KeyWords and Reserved Words both are same 
    Like int, float, double, bool, return, if, else, for, while, switch and many more 

    int double1 = 1; This is valid name
    int double = 3.1445545 Invalid name

    Variables:
        Varaible Declaration:
            Variable Declaration is just like to create a new variable
            int x;

        Variable Initialization:
            Variable Initialization is to pass or assign some value to a variable is known as variable Initialization
            x = 20;

            int x = 50;
            We will us If-Else Statements using Logical operator
            if else
            >=, <=, ==, !=, These are comparison operator in C++
